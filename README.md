# FallibleDemo

This repository is a sample project demonstrating the use of the Fallible classes I described in my blog post ["A better way of handling exceptions"](http://www.pixata.co.uk/2018/05/31/a-better-way-of-handling-exceptions/).

This sample provides the full Fallible classes code, as well as demonstrating the extras you need for working with WCF. See the blog post for more details.
